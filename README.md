# Objective

Gustavo just started an e-commerce startup based on Portugal that recently opened an online website to sell their product. Fortunately, Gustavo is launching their website when the covid-19 hits and making them grow faster than ever. However, Gustavo is still not using targeted marketing which hurt their marketing budget as only a fraction of their user comes back to website. Gustavo needs your help to increase their marketing conversion rate doing more targeted marketing using customer segmentation so that it will not hurt their budget.
